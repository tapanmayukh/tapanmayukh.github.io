Hey, Thank you for your visit. I am an aspiring astrophysicist and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Astrophysics at [LMU Munich](https://usm.uni-muenchen.de). I obtained my undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in). I graduated from the program in `2021`, and have been working towards a career in academia since then.

I like to work in the field of Analytical and Numerical study of Fluid Dynamics in the presence of Magnetic fields. The order in the Energy cascade that emerges from the chaos of MHD Turbulence excites me. Under the supervision of [Dr Pankaj Kumar Mishra](https://www.iitg.ac.in/pankaj.mishra/), I studied the nature of the Energy spectrum and Energy cascade of 3D MHD Turbulence, as a part of my undergraduate thesis.

Apart from the academics, I love Observational Astronomy. Travelling through the night sky, equipped with a telescope is my favourite pastime. I have also worked as the Secretary of [Equinox - The Astronomy Club](https://www.iitg.ac.in/stud/gymkhana/technical/home/EquinoxHome.html) at IIT Guwahati. I lack creativity, but sometimes I dabble in generative art and creative coding. Finally, I love Linguistics, Conlanging and Worldbuilding in general.
