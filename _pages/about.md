Hey, Thank you for your visit. I am an aspiring astrophysicist and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Astrophysics degree at [USM](https://www.usm.lmu.de/), [LMU Munich](https://usm.uni-muenchen.de). Therein, I am working on my Master's Thesis on *Multiphase Turbulence in a Stratified Medium* with the [Multiphase Gas Group](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1020167/multiphase-gas) under the supervision of [Dr Max Gr√∂nke](https://max.lyman-alpha.com/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/).

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in) in `2021`. Under the supervision of [Dr Pankaj Kumar Mishra](https://www.iitg.ac.in/pankaj.mishra/), I studied the nature of the Energy spectrum and Energy cascade of 3D MHD Turbulence, as a part of my undergraduate thesis. Since then, I have been working my way up in the field of Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics.

Apart from the academics, I love Observational Astronomy. Travelling through the night sky, equipped with a telescope is my favourite pastime. I have also worked as the Secretary of [Equinox - The Astronomy Club](https://www.iitg.ac.in/stud/gymkhana/technical/home/EquinoxHome.html) at IIT Guwahati. I lack creativity, but sometimes I dabble in generative art and creative coding. Finally, I love Linguistics, Conlanging and Worldbuilding in general.
